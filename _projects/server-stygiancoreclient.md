> Procedural water never looked right to me, so it's not included. I tried to enable it just for the ocean with no luck, and it doesn't look right in smaller pools or in water sources in town. I find the default water to be the best looking overall. If you know how to enable it for just the ocean let me know!

## INTERFACE

I've included a few essential add-ons that I modified to work with StygianCore as well as a library of other popular addons for WoW 3.3.5a.

- [Random Animated Login Screens](https://rebrand.ly/randomloginscreens)
- Carbonite 3.3.4 -  Customized for StygianCore
- [TrinityMagic](https://github.com/karlbunch/LordKator_TrinityMagic) - Adds a Teleport function to the Carbonite Mini-Map among other useful features. This feature is awesome!
- TrinityAdmin - Updated for StygianCore/AzerothCore
- An addon library including a lot of popular and useful addons for WoW 3.3.5a
- Additional Login Screen Patches (Classic WoW & The Burning Crusade)

## TOOLS

- SCClearCacheRun.bat - Clears the client cache and loads WoW
- SCUpdateIP.bat - Client IP Switching Utility

## EXTRA

- Large Address Aware
- HD D3D/OpenGL Upgrade

#### This project is dedicated to the late Michel Martin Koiter (May 4, 1984 â€“ March 18, 2004). His shrine in World of Warcraft served as a place of solace for myself, my guildmates, and countless others in the classic days of World of Warcraft and beyond.
